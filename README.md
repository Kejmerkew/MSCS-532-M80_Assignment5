# Quicksort Algorithm: Deterministic and Randomized Implementation

## Overview

This project implements both **Deterministic Quicksort** and **Randomized Quicksort** in Python.  
It includes a performance comparison across different input distributions (random, sorted, and reverse-sorted) and input sizes.  
The experiment demonstrates how randomization mitigates worst-case scenarios while maintaining \(O(n \log n)\) expected performance.
Analysis is included in "Assignment5.docx"
